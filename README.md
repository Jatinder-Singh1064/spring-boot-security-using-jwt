# spring-boot-security-using-jwt
This Spring Boot based application serves as an example of how to use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens). The next request from the client will be authenticated by using the produced JWT token if it is made before the token expiration time. It first validates the incoming request and creates a JWT token using a suitable algorithm that is valid for a time period.

Developed using Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA, Maven, Spring Tool Suite, MySQL and GIT.
